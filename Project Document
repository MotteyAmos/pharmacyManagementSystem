##Introduction 
We were given the assignment to develop a pharmacy management system as our semester project. To develop the application, this project required the usage of a variety of data structures, including lists, LinkedLists, stacks, arrays, and queues. Additionally, certain objects needed to be found in the database and sorted alphabetically using the proper searching and sorting methods.
Description
Pharmacies can effectively manage their inventory and transactions thanks to the pharmacy management system that was designed for this project. The drug purchase history for each drug is viewable, along with specifics like the buyer, date, time, and quantity purchased. The system also can add substances and search for drugs. 
The project not only provided practical experience in implementing data structures and algorithms but also aimed to enhance our skills in software development, teamwork, and project management.
